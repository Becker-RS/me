The repositories you want to appear in your profile page's project catalog put the `me` tag.

You can change the tag to another one you prefer
but you will need to change a line of code

## GitHub API

The HTML fields are filled using data from github.

The endpoint used are:

- [api.github.com/users/:user](https://api.github.com/users/rafaelbmateus)
- [api.github.com/users/:user/repos](https://api.github.com/users/rafaelbmateus/repos)

## Running localhost

Clone repository

```console
git clone git@github.com:rafaelbmateus/me.git
cd me
```

Build the page using:

```console
GITHUB_USERNAME=<username> python3 builder/main.py
```
